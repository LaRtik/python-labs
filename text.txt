When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday 
presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the
 racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise
 - unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch
  him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.
He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and
Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.
 He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the
 nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a
 bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his
  Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
